# Omnifest File Format

An omnifest file is a [YAML](https://yaml.org) file containing targets for various [operating system image creation tools](https://github.com/OSMakers/image-build-tools/blob/main/Linux-Image-Creation-Tools.rst). Its default extension is `.yaml`. Omnifest files are processed by [otk](https://github.com/osbuild/otk) -- omnifest toolkit. This document describes the structure of `.yaml` files.
